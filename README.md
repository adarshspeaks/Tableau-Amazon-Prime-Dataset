# Amazon Prime Video Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Amazon Prime Video dataset to extract insights into  content performance, and market trends. The analysis aims to identify key patterns and provide Data Information's Automatically  

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on movies and TV shows available on Amazon Prime Video. It contains various attributes such as:
- **Title:** The name of the movie or TV show.
- **Genre:** Categories or genres of the content (e.g., Drama, Comedy, Action).
- **Release Year:** The year the content was released.
- **Rating:** User ratings for the content.
- **Duration:** Length of the content (e.g., 120 minutes for movies, 1 season for TV shows).
- **Country  Details about the content's country of origin

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   - Normalized data formats for attributes like date, genre, and duration.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed the distribution of content across different genres and release years.
   - Examined the correlation between ratings and other factors such as genre, country, and release year.
   - Identified top-performing content based on user ratings.


## Results & Insights
- Identified the most popular genres and their performance over time.
- Analyzed user ratings to find the most critically acclaimed content.
- Provided recommendations for content acquisition and strategy based on trends and patterns.

## Conclusion
This analysis of the Amazon Prime Video dataset provided valuable insights into the platform's content library and user engagement. The findings can be leveraged to inform strategic decisions in content acquisition, marketing, and user experience enhancement.

## Future Work
- Expand the analysis to include more advanced machine learning models for recommendation systems.
- Integrate additional datasets (e.g., social media trends, competitor data) for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Develop a real-time dashboard to monitor trends and performance metrics continuously.
